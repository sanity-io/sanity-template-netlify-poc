# sanity.io/create starter template starter for Netlify

This is a barebones example of how to create a starter template for <a href="https://www.sanity.io/create?template=sanity-io/sanity-template-netlify-poc">sanity.io/create</a>.

It contains a `.sanity-template` folder with all the information to treat this repository as a new Sanity Starter (assets, data, and manifest), as well as a `studio` directory with a barebones Studio, and a `web` directory with a simple script to display data from the new Sanity project.
